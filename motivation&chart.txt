motivation
Pokemon is a popular game among people of all ages. Its battle involves luck, strategy, and fun.
 However, the normal pokemon games has some deficiencies that is hard to resolve in the original
version. Such as the long process of catching pokemons, training them to a certain level, and
difficulty in finding another human player. Our design aims to eliminate all the deficiencies 
and directly gives an oppurtunity for pokemons fans to enjoy the fun of pokemon fight.
We aims to set up an online pokemon fighting platform that enables our users to choose pokemons
on their own and fight against their friends or other players around the world. In the platform,
the users can skip the the long process of catching and training pokemonsm and help them to 
find their friends or other pokemon fans online and start fighting with their favorite pokemons.
